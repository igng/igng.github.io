# ようこそ

My name is Andrea and I am a PhD student in Control Systems Engineering at University of "Tor Vergata", Rome. My research interests are: _optimal control, robust control_ and _distributed control_.

---

This page is a collection of: BSc/MSc courseworks, PhD articles and side projects. I am gradually updating the repositories, but it will take some time (_sigh_).

### BSc/MSc courseworks:
* [Algorithms Engineering](https://github.com/igng/secondshortestpath): find the second shortest path in a weighted undirected cyclic graph [Python]
* [Industrial Robotic](https://github.com/igng/RI): compute the Euler-Lagrange motion of equations for some robotic manipulator (e.g. PUMA, SCARA). It also contains an algorithm to explore an unknown room [MATLAB, Maxima, Robomind]
* [Robust and Adaptive Control](https://github.com/igng/CRS): compute a Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) and an H-infinity based controller [MATLAB]
* [Optimization Methods for Big Data](https://github.com/igng/PBH): compute the minimum of the Lennard-Jones potential (LJ-potential) using the Population Basin Hopping (PBH) algorithm [AMPL]

### PhD articles:
* [Modal Consensus of Single Integrators With Minimal “Disagreement Interaction” via Distributed Endogenous Internal Model
](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9125970) | Control design strategy that minimizes a detrimental exchange of information in a "modal consensus of a network of agents" problem, based on the notion of "Distributed Endogenous Internal Model". (the repository is missing)

### Side projects
* [Rastroberry](https://github.com/igng/Rastroberry): using a Raspberry Pi3, an Arduino Micro, an IMU and stepper-motors to automatically track a celestial body with a Skywatcher 130/90 (work in progress)
* [GoogleHashCode 2017](https://github.com/igng/Google-Hashcode-2017): solution for the Google Hashcode 2017 qualification round [AMPL]
* [ProjectEuler](https://github.com/igng/ProjectEuler): collection of solutions for the ProjectEuler problems [Python, MATLAB]
* [NASA SpaceAppsChallenge 2018](https://github.com/igng/LTE): generate, given an input image, a puzzle to be reconstructed [Processing]
* [Vitruvian Frame](https://github.com/igng/vitruvian_frame): 3D design of a frame to test the capabilities of a drone [FreeCAD]
* [RaspIMU](https://github.com/igng/RaspIMU): library to use a MPU6050 Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) with the Raspberry Pi board [C] (work in progress)
